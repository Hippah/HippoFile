# HippoFile
A light weight file system for java. Has its own objects and elements, has a built in encryption system.

Why HippoFile?
HippoFile is very lightweight, and super easy to use. Yet it's very powerful.

INFO: 

File Extension: .hippo

Format:

MyObject{(MyElement[MyValue])}

The encryption system comes with a standard encryptor and decryptor.
The system has support for multiple encryptors and decrytors to work on one file.
If encryption is your main priority then I would recomend to make your own implmentation of Encrypter.

Free to use, maybe a little credit though?
